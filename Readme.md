## Services

There are 3 different projects:

### Node Bot: 
- simulates the scraping of a payload (variable in size)
- sends the payload to the *Node S3 simulator*
- sends the link generated by the *Node S3 simulator* to the *Symfony Backend* (the Symfony backend acts as the API Gateway that has a limit of 10MB)  

### Node S3 Simulator
- Receives a Payload of any size and stores it in a public folder
- Returns the URL of the saved json file

### Symfony Backend
- Acts as the API Gateway
- Exposes an API to save the url of the huge payload to download
- It has a command that:
  - download in stream the payload from the *Node S3 simulator*
  - loads the Flyers in its database, in chunks

## Instructions to start the microservices with the ssh script
From the root of the project:

`./start-microservices.sh`

Enter the _node_bot_ project with:

`cd node_bot`

`docker-compose exec node_bot bash` to enter the container of the _node_bot_

`npm start` from inside the container of the node_bot

Run it several times and you will see two things: 

1. inside the _node_S3_simulator_ project, in the uploads folder, the payloads.
2. inside the _symfony-backend_ database, in the payload table, the links generated by _node_S3_simulator_ API


To import the flyers in the database, enter the _symfony-backend_ project with:

`cd symfony-backend`

`docker exec -it php8_symfony bash` to enter the container of the _symfony-backend_

`bin/console app:import-payload` to start the command that imports in bulks the flyers (in production this would be a scheduled cron task)

Check the flyer table to see the imported flyers.


## Instructions to start the microservices without the ssh script
Create the Docker shared network:

`docker network create fabiomanzo_network`

Follow the instructions in the Readme.md in each project, following this order:

1. _symfony-backend_
2. _node_bot_
3. _node_S3_simulator_

`docker-compose exec node_bot bash` to enter the container of the node_bot

`npm start` from inside the container of the node_bot
