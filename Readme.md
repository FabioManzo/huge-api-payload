## Services

There are 3 different projects that act like 3 micoservices connected with each other thanks to a shared Docker network:

### Node Bot: 
- simulates the scraping of a payload (it generates it dynamically. The number of Flyers generated is configurable in the node_bot/.env file)
- sends the payload to the *Node S3 simulator* (S3 has no limits, contrary to the API Gateway)
- sends the link generated by the *Node S3 simulator* to the *Symfony Backend* (the Symfony backend acts as the API Gateway that has a limit of 10MB, so we only send a light payload)  

### Node S3 Simulator
- Receives a Payload of any size and stores it in a public folder
- Returns the URL of the saved json file

### Symfony Backend
- Acts as the API Gateway
- Exposes an API to save the url of the huge payload to download
- It has a command that:
  - download in stream the payload from the *Node S3 simulator*
  - loads the Flyers in its database, in chunks

## Instructions to start the microservices with the ssh script
From the root of the project:

`./start-microservices.sh` to build and start all the Docker containers 

### _symfony-backend_ (install dependencies and the create the database)
Enter the _symfony-backend_ project with:

`cd symfony-backend`

`docker-compose exec php8_symfony bash` to enter the container of the _symfony-backend_

`composer install` from inside the container of the _symfony-backend_

`bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate` from inside the container of the _symfony-backend_, to create the tables

`exit` to exit the container

### _node_S3_simulator_
Enter the _node_S3_simulator_ project with:

`cd ../node_S3_simulator`

`docker-compose exec node_backend bash` to enter the container of the _node_S3_simulator_

`npm start` from inside the container of the node_bot

### _node_bot_
Open another terminal and enter the _node_bot_ project with:

`cd ../node_bot`

`docker-compose exec node_bot bash` to enter the container of the _node_bot_

`npx tsc` from inside the container of the node_bot, to compila ts into js

`node dist/index.js` to start the main script

Run it several times and you will see two things: 

1. inside the _node_S3_simulator_ project, in the uploads folder, the payloads.
2. inside the _symfony-backend_ database, in the payload table, the links generated by _node_S3_simulator_ API

`exit` to exit the container

### _symfony-backend_
To import the flyers in the database, enter the _symfony-backend_ project with:

`cd ../symfony-backend`

`docker exec -it php8_symfony bash` to enter the container of the _symfony-backend_

`bin/console app:import-payload` to start the command that imports in bulks the flyers (in production this would be a scheduled cron task)

Check the flyer table to see the imported flyers.

Run several times, until it imports all the flyers in the flyer table and then passes to the next payload.

## Additional info
To simplify and speed up the process, the generated payloads have only few Flyers. 
  - Increase the number of Flyers generated in the node_bot/.env file
  - Increase the chunkSize in symfony-backend/.env

To start again the build and configuration from zero, run:

`./cleanup.sh` from the root (it deletes all the generated files and the Symfony DB stored in a local volume)
